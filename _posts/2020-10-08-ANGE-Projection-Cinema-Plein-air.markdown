In our [Manyland hub](/Play2PlayEvent/) we built an open air cinema and made a projection of the movie [ANGE](https://fleuryfontaine.fr/ange/) by the artistic duo [FleuryFontaine](https://fleuryfontaine.fr/ange/). 

The second meeting of the evening was at [Romain Gandolphe's digital museum](https://manyland.com/romain) where he made an amazing performance for us and took us along a fantastic visit amongst his work.
