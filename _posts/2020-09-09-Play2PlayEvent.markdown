Online exhibition, event, meeting, performance and collaborative creation
WMAN gathered in Manyland to build an exhibition space called WMAN Hub. This area was a welcoming hub and an unofficial backstage of the festival OurNetworks (http://ournetworks.ca)
During the opening, people were invited to come and build a second room alltogether, melting crafting, drawing and dancing skills alltogether. 
WMAN crew will be online in this space the 09/09, 10/09, 11/09, and 12/09 to welcome people that want to come and play ! 

A big thank you to OurNetworks, and to Tiphaine, Vlad, Phebus, Briwa, name: _ , Marion, Benjamin, Henry, Simon, Mami écrase les prou, Dawn Walker, SpruggleDancer, & OB for building with us ! much love
